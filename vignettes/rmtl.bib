   abstract = {Motivation: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning technique for simultaneous learning of multiple related classification or regression tasks. Despite its increasing popularity, MTL algorithms are currently not available in the widely used software environment R, creating a bottleneck for their application in biomedical research. Results: We developed an efficient, easy-to-use R library for MTL (www.r-project.org) comprising 10 algorithms applicable for regression, classification, joint predictor selection, task clustering, low-rank learning and incorporation of biological networks. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithms using simulated data. Availability: The RMTL package is an open source R package and is freely available at https://github.com/transbioZI/RMTL. RMTL will also be available on cran.r-project.org. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   abstract = {The requirement of innovative big data analytics has become a critical success factor for research in biological psychiatry. Integrative analyses across distributed data resources are considered essential for untangling the biological complexity of mental illnesses. However, little is known about algorithm properties for such integrative machine learning. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of eight machine learning algorithms for identification of reproducible biological fingerprints across data sources, using five transcriptome-wide expression datasets of schizophrenia patients and controls as a use case. We found that multi-task learning (MTL) with network structure (MTL_NET) showed superior accuracy compared to other MTL formulations as well as single task learning, and tied performance with support vector machines (SVM). Compared to SVM, MTL_NET showed significant benefits regarding the variability of accuracy estimates, as well as its robustness to cross-dataset and sampling variability. These results support the utility of this algorithm as a flexible tool for integrative machine learning in psychiatry.},

   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Identifying biomarkers that can track the progress of the disease has recently received increasing attentions in AD research. An accurate prediction of disease progression would facilitate optimal decision-making for clinicians and patients. A definitive diagnosis of AD requires autopsy confirmation, thus many clinical/cognitive measures including Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) have been designed to evaluate the cognitive status of the patients and used as important criteria for clinical diagnosis of probable AD. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting disease progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting biomarkers predictive of the progression. Specifically, we formulate the prediction problem as a multi-task regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point as a task and propose two novel multi-task learning formulations. We have performed extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we use the baseline MRI features to predict MMSE/ADAS-Cog scores in the next 4 years. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-task learning formulations for disease progression in comparison with single-task learning algorithms including ridge regression and Lasso. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression. We observe that cortical thickness average of left middle temporal, cortical thickness average of left and right Entorhinal, and white matter volume of left Hippocampus play significant roles in predicting ADAS-Cog at all time points. We also observe that several MRI biomarkers provide significant information for predicting MMSE scores for the first 2 years, however very few are shown to be significant in predicting MMSE score at later stages. The lack of predictable MRI biomarkers in later stages may contribute to the lower prediction performance of MMSE than that of ADAS-Cog in our study and other related studies.},

   abstract = {Precision oncology seeks to predict the best therapeutic option for individual patients based on the molecular characteristics of their tumors. To assess the preclinical feasibility of drug sensitivity prediction, several studies have measured drug responses for cytotoxic and targeted therapies across large collections of genomically and transcriptomically characterized cancer cell lines and trained predictive models using standard methods like elastic net regression. Here we use existing drug response data sets to demonstrate that multitask learning across drugs strongly improves the accuracy and interpretability of drug prediction models. Our method uses trace norm regularization with a highly efficient ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) optimization algorithm that readily scales to large data sets. We anticipate that our approach will enhance efforts to exploit growing drug response compendia in order to advance personalized therapy.},

   abstract = {Gene-expression data are now widely available and used for a wide range of clinical and diagnostic purposes. A key challenge is to select a few significant marker genes for biological studies. While it is feasible to find important genes from a single gene-expression data set, it is often more meaningful to compare the results from different but related data sets together, especially for multiple gene-expression data sets arising from different studies of a common organism or phenotype. In this paper, we present a novel framework to exploit the commonalities across different data sets by jointly learning from different data sets simultaneously through multi-task feature learning. By identifying a common subspace of genes, we can help biologists find important marker genes that span different evolutionary periods in the life cycle of cancer development. The genes thus found are more stable and more significant. Our experimental results demonstrate that more accurate models can be built using multiple data sets based on fewer labelled examples. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to introduce multi-task learning in the bioinformatics community to solve the lack of data problem.},
